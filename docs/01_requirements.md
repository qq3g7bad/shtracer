# üìç Requirements

## üìÉ 1. Use `config.md` for configuration

<!-- @REQ1.1@ -->
### To make a requirements traceablity matrix, use a configuration file.

* This file is written in markdown format.
  * e.g. `../sample/config.md`.
  * Markdown is easy to learn, easy to reuse, and environment-independent.
* Markdown files are just regular text files, so changes can be easily managed in an SCM (such as git).

<!-- @REQ1.2@ -->
### This file has the file structure information to trace.

* Each section indicates the target layer structure.
* In the section, the following format information should be written.
  * Written in the listed format by writing `*` at the beginning.
  * A field is consits of name (left) and value (right). These are separated by ":".
    * The name in a field has **bold style**.
    * The value in a field are surrounded by double quotations.
  * Multiple `PATH` indformation are acceptable.
* If a section name is `(fork)`, the following sub-section are separated.

#### Field format

Name               | Value
------------------ | --------
Trace target       | Mandatory. Section name. This is used for constructing the trace structure.
`PATH`             | Mandatory. Target file path (a directory or a file).
`BRIEF`            | Optional. Brief information.
`TAG FORMAT`       | Optional. Written in [BRE](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/html_node/BRE-syntax.html). If `TAG FORMAT` is not written, ShellTracer make trace to the file not the items in the file.
`TAG LINE FORMAT`  | Optional. Written in [BRE](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/html_node/BRE-syntax.html).
`TAG-TITLE OFFSET` | Optional. Set the offset value between the tag and its related title. **Title is individual elements to trace.**

```markdown
## Trace target

* **PATH**:  "target path 1"
* **BRIEF**: "brief information"
* **TAG FORMAT**: `@REQ[0-9\.]+@`
* **TAG LINE FORMAT**: `<!--.*-->`
* **TAG-TITLE OFFSET**: 2
```

* Tags are searched by the combination `TAG FORMAT` and `TAG LINE FORMAT`.
  * So that this `@REQ1.1.1@` will not be extracted by shtracer.
  * This pseudo-tag (`@REQ1.1.1@`) has `TAG FORMAT` but has no `TAG LINE FORMAT`.

<!-- @REQ1.2.1@ -->
#### Tracing Tags by Content vs. Filename

* If `TAG_FORMAT` is not empty, shtracer open filename.
* If `TAG_FORMAT` is empty, shtracer trace only by filename.

<!-- @REQ1.3@ -->
### The file structure can be convert to UML format by executing scripts.

* Output the result as a markdown file.
  * `./output/structure/uml.md`

<!-- @REQ1.4@ -->
### Check if configuration file are written correctly.

* [ ] The file/directory written in `PATH` exist.
* [ ] If `PATH` are directory, the `EXTENSION FILTER` field are written correctly.
* [ ] Tags are exist on `PATH` file.
* [ ] Tags are not duplicated.

## üì• 2. Input

<!-- @REQ2.1@ -->
### Use text files

* Normal text files are easy to manage under SCM (such as git).
* Markdown is acceptable, as are text files for programs (e.g. `*.c`, `*.cpp`).
  * But proprietary binary files such as MSexcel files must be converted to text files first.
  * It may seem like a pain but is important for easy change management.
* Each file has tag data.
  * They are written in a specific tag format written in config file (e.g. `<!-- @REQ[0-9\.]+@.* -->`).
  * If `(FROM:.*)` is included in the tag, it indicates that the tag written immediately after it is upstream of this tag.

<!-- @REQ2.2@ -->
### (Optional) Convert MSexcel (`*.xlsx`) or MSword (`*.docx`) format trace target to markdown files.

* It is not mandatory.
* Since it relies on other proprietary programs, you may wish to use tools other than shell scripts.

## üì§ 3. Output

### Between two trace targets.

<!-- @REQ3.1.1@ -->
#### Make a text file which explain the relationship between two trace targets.

* The relationship between tags are shown by a simple text table (nx2).
  * column 1: start tag
  * column 2: next connected tag
* Each tag has a hyperlink to the file that contains it.

<!-- @REQ3.1.2@ -->
#### Make a cross-reference table for easy reference.

* Cross-refernce tables are made in markdown format.
* An example is shown below.
* Each tag has a hyperlink to the file that contains it.

.         | @ARC1.2@ | @ARC1.1@ | @ARC2.1@ | @ARC2.2@ |
--------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
@REQ1.1@  | x        | x        |          |          |
@REQ1.2@  |          | x        |          |          |
@REQ1.3@  | x        |          |          | x        |
@REQ2.1@  | x        |          | x        |          |

### Between all trace targets.

<!-- @REQ3.2.1@ -->
#### Make a text file which explain the relationship between all trace targets.

* The relationship between tags are shown by a simple text table.
  * In the table format, you can see forward and backward flow by sorting a column.
* Isolated tags which have no relationship with other tags, those should be shown as is.
* Each tag has a hyperlink to the file that contains it.

<!-- @REQ3.2.2@ -->
#### Make a UML which explain the relationship between all trace targets.

* The relationship between tags are shown by UML that can be written as text format.

<!-- @REQ3.3@ -->
### (Optional) Convert trace output markdown files to MSexcel (`*.xlsx`) or MSword (`*.docx`) format.

* It is not mandatory.
* Since it relies on other proprietary programs, you may wish to use tools other than shell scripts.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 4. Options

<!-- @REQ4.1@ -->
### Rename tag

* Change tag name based on input.

<!-- @REQ4.2@ -->
### Run test

<!-- @REQ4.3@ -->
### Verify

* Check if there are invalid config/tag information.

<!-- @REQ5.1@ -->
## ‚≠ï 5. Nice-to-have requirements

* Must-have-requirements (these are written above) have their own tags for trace.
* Nice-to-have requirements don't have any tag and not traced.

### Use shell scripts other than optional scripts

* For portability, use only shell scripts to create the RTM.
* In the case of optional scripts, there are already useful tools.
  * Use there tools.
  * Although the language or environment is not important, portability is a priority.

### Unit test each function

* Use [shUnit2](https://github.com/kward/shunit2) (for unit testing).

### Reduce dependence on specific shells and be as POSIX compliant as possible.

<!-- @REQ6.1@ -->
## üìó 6. Definition

* **Trace target**: File or directory which has information to trace.
* **Tag** : In trace target, there are some tags to discriminate details of trace information. `shtracer` trace the relationship between each tag.
* **From tag** : Each tag has its "from tag". "From tag" means upstream tags which connect to the tag.
* **Tag table** : Tag tables are consisted of two column data as shown below. The left column have upstream tags, and the right column have downstream tags.
